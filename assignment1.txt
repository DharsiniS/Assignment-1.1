4. Need and Working of  hadoop:
	
	Need of hadoop-Hadoop can handle large volume of data be it structured or unstructured or semi-structured more efficiently than the traditional methods
		        and it is cost saving than the traditional methods and because of that robust community support that is evolving.
	Working of hadoop-Hadoop is a collection of libraries and each library has it own task to perform.HDFS(hadoop distributed file system)
		              writes once to the server and reads it many times. Jobtracker,this manges all the tasks and executes the job.Mapreduce is used to schedule
		               the processes and hence the hadoop madreduce is used to execute sequence of jobs.
